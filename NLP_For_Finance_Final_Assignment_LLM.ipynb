

            "    Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to [COMPANY] 2017 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.     Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of non GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading [COMPANY]. The duration of our call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 '17. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q3 '17 and full year 2017 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's [COMPANY] session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of [COMPANY] and Symetis over the relevant prior year period. Also note, this call contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full year 2017 guidance; as well as our tax rates, [COMPANY] spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10 K and subsequent 10 [COMPANY] filed with the [COMPANY]. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Thanks, Mike.     Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. [COMPANY] delivered strong results again in the second quarter of '17. Organic revenue growth of 6% and operational revenue growth of 7% were ahead of both expectations and underlying market growth rates. It was an excellent quarter in light of a challenging 10% organic revenue growth comparison in the second quarter of '16. These results are also a reflection of our strong execution and success of our category leadership strategy. We leveraged that 7% revenue growth to deliver 18% adjusted [COMPANY] growth or a $0.32 per share and $0.01 above Wall Street consensus. If you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted [COMPANY] grew 24% year over year. Key to this very high level of [COMPANY] growth was a 260 basis point year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 26%, led by a strong 72.8% gross margin result and a 40 basis point reduction year over year in SGA spending to 35.5% of revenue. Also, as detailed on our Investor Day last month, we aim to deliver this type of consistent revenue growth and double digit adjusted [COMPANY] growth over the long term. We continue to enhance the growth profile of the company, with plans to enter the $13 billion in new high growth markets across our businesses over the next few years. Importantly, we believe [COMPANY] continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value and differentiated [COMPANY] growth due to our revenue growth profile, opportunity to improve operating margins and a strengthening balance sheet. We're also excited about the second half of '17 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long term growth in '18 and beyond. We're raising our full year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth with a 6% to 8% range, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full year contribution from the [COMPANY] and Symetis acquisitions. We're also raising our full year adjusted [COMPANY] guidance by $0.01, from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26, to a revised range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% earnings growth. Importantly, this revised [COMPANY] guidance includes an expected $0.08 negative impact or approximate 700 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 '17 results and thoughts on our second half '17 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year over year constant currency basis, unless otherwise specified. Our Q2 organic revenue growth of 6% continues to be broad based across our product lines, with most of our businesses growing faster than the underlying markets. [COMPANY] grew an impressive 10%; [COMPANY], 5%; and [COMPANY], 3%. We also delivered a strong balanced organic growth across geographies, led by a 7% revenue growth in the U.S. and [COMPANY], 14% in emerging markets and 20% growth specifically in China. In Europe, our business was impacted from the [COMPANY] recall, yet they still delivered 2% growth in the quarter. Turning to a few [COMPANY] highlights. The 3 [COMPANY] businesses delivered an impressive 10% organic revenue growth and 12% operational growth, including the recently acquired [COMPANY]. In [COMPANY], organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter and 12% including the acquisition, led by the strength of our franchises in hemostasis, pathology and endoluminal surgery. Of note, in hemostasis, we're seeing faster than expected conversion to our new Resolution 360 Clip platform, which led to mid teens growth for the franchise. Regionally, [COMPANY] results were particularly strong in the U.S. and Latin America. 7 months after closing the [COMPANY] acquisition, we have completed the sales integration, and revenue is slightly ahead of plan, contributing to 80 basis points of total growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in pathology, infection control and prevention and the ambulatory surgeries in our market. Additionally, our recently signed agreement with [COMPANY] allows us to offer convenient scope repair services to this important customer base. Our Uro and pelvic health business have continued the strong performance that grew 10% in the quarter, led by our single use digital LithoVue ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. This 10% growth is particularly impressive considering an 18% growth comparison in second quarter '16. So overall, the Uro health business grew double digit in the U.S., [COMPANY] and Latin America. And emerging market sales were also very strong, led by our [COMPANY] and men's health franchises. LithoVue remains an important driver for our urology business, providing single use digital visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter, while avoiding the needs for repairs or sterilization that can be a very big challenge with reusable scopes. LithoVue is now in more than 900 accounts worldwide, and we're seeing faster growth and pull through of our core kidney stone business with customers that use LithoVue. We continue to see important research studies that support the trend towards single use systems, which bodes well for the longer term outlook. And the [COMPANY] also recently determined that manufacturers of certain reusable medical devices now need to include validation data regarding cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. We remain very encouraged by the LithoVue opportunity. Turning to [COMPANY]. Revenue in [COMPANY]ulation grew 14% in the second quarter, driven by multiple new product launches, including the Montage MRI system and the [COMPANY] full body MRI paddle and spinal cord stimulation as well as the Vercise Gevia MRI Deep Brain Stimulation System in Europe. Gevia features our Neural Navigator 2 with [COMPANY], which allows clinicians to visualize the stimulation field while customizing DBS stimulation programs for patients. We expect to launch into the U.S. DBS market by year end '17 or early '18, followed by our traditional   followed by our directional lead in MRI conditioning label in 2018. It's really an exciting time in spinal cord stimulation as we recently published Illumina 24 month data, and the PROCO randomized controlled trial data was presented at [COMPANY]. The PROCO data showed that frequency is not a determining factor in spinal cord stimulation pain relief. 1 kilohertz therapy had equivalent results to 10 kilohertz, and [COMPANY] Precision [COMPANY] uses 1 kilohertz and thus uses 2/3 less energy than high frequency systems with the equivalent outcomes for pain relief. This reinforces the need and benefit for flexible technology platforms like [COMPANY] that can enable physicians to customize therapy for the unique pain patients. Turning to our [COMPANY] group. The [COMPANY] group grew 5% in the second quarter '17 against a very tough 13% growth comparison in second quarter '16. So starting off with our [COMPANY] business. [COMPANY] in the quarter grew 7%, a particularly strong performance in Asia and Europe, led by sales of our stent portfolio, our next generation Innova Stent for the [COMPANY], drug eluting Eluvia stents in Europe and WALLSTENT. We also saw strong growth from our atherectomy JetStream platform and are promising initial launch of our OPTICROSS intravascular ultrasound platform for peripheral applications. Drug eluting technologies contributed nicely to European growth. And in the U.S., enrollment in the [COMPANY] trial for [COMPANY] continues on pace. We also wait 12 month follow up for an [COMPANY] trial for Eluvia drug eluting stents. In [COMPANY], that business grew second quarter organic revenue of 4% and operational revenue of 5% despite the impact of the [COMPANY] recall in Europe. Our growth was led by strong sales of our [COMPANY], mid teens revenue growth in PCI Guidance, mid single digit growth in Complex PCI and early contributions from the Symetis [COMPANY] platform in Europe. The [COMPANY] platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum. We're focused on market development activities such as deploying therapy awareness reps, increasing our medical education programs, social media outreach and direct to patient awareness programs. We remain on track to end '17 with 350 to 375 U.S. centers. We also achieved an important clinical milestone in [COMPANY] by completing the enrollment in [COMPANY] trial. This trial is specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. And we target mid '19 Japan approval for [COMPANY]. Global DES sales in the quarter were up 1% despite a challenging 9% growth comparison in second quarter '16, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform. Products for Complex PCI procedures grew in the upper mid single digits, led by strong atherectomy and cutting balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business continues to build momentum with strong [COMPANY] sales and the launch of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. On [COMPANY]. [COMPANY] remediation work remains on track. We expect [COMPANY] to return to the [COMPANY] market by year end '17 and a fourth quarter submission of our U.S. PMA for regulatory approval in the U.S. We continue to estimate a mid '18 launch in the U.S. 9 weeks post closing, we're on track with our Symetis integration plans, including training of our Uro [COMPANY] field reps on the [COMPANY] valve platform. As highlighted at our recent Investor Day conference, we believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of physicians and patients with our differentiated [COMPANY] portfolio. There's no change to our clinical trial priorities, including pursuing [COMPANY] in the U.S. and Japan, and a [COMPANY] intermediate risk indication. We will aim to provide more details of our [COMPANY] clinical plans in the coming months. We're also very well positioned at vascular and structural heart market with our strong momentum in LAAC and potential per share taking in [COMPANY] via both [COMPANY] and [COMPANY]. We're also raising our expected '17 structural heart revenue guidance from $250 million to approximately $275 million to reflect the revenue impact from the Symetis acquisition, which closed in May. Shifting to [COMPANY]. Global CRM sales grew 2%, which outpaced the challenging worldwide market growth of the industry. Our focus on [COMPANY] profitability has really paid off, resulting in extremely strong adjusted operating margin of 20.9%, which is up 720 basis points year over year, which Dan will detail in a few minutes. As for product trends, brady sales grew mid single digits, and we continue to gain share. However, our growth did slow a bit from prior quarters due to the anniversary of our ACCOLADE MRI brady platform as well as the competitor's launch. We also saw very strong growth globally in [COMPANY], our quad X4 CRT P and encouraging initial launch feedback of our new RESONATE platform in Europe as well as a slight uptick in CRT D replacement cycle sales, consistent with our replacement curve models. We have submitted clinical data from our [COMPANY] MRI study to [COMPANY] and continue to expect to launch our transvenous MRI compatible high voltage system in the U.S. by year end. Turning to EP. We grew sales 13% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new [COMPANY] HDx platform. We continue to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and now in the U.S. and Japan. We look forward to launching our IntellaNav MiFi open irrigated catheter   therapeutic catheter   wow, IntellaNav MiFi open irrigated therapeutic catheter in the [COMPANY] and U.S. in third quarter as well as beginning a limited market evaluation of our [COMPANY] technology in the [COMPANY] as enabled by our new software upgrade for [COMPANY]. So to wrap up, [COMPANY]'s portfolio strategy, our globalization efforts and execution of our global teams continues to work, and we continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. We believe we are poised for an exciting second half of '17 and that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record in 2018 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees again for their winning spirit and strong commitment to the company in advancing science for life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.     Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2,257,000,000 represents 6% growth on both a reported and organic basis, and 7% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. This strong top line also reflects a $23 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $12 million or approximately 55 basis points less compared to a $35 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. The contribution from the recent acquisitions was approximately 120 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of the strong performance of the pathology business acquired with the [COMPANY] deal and sales from the recently closed Symetis acquisition that was not included in the guidance. After adjusting for the performance of the acquisitions, we still exceeded our 5% to 6% operational guidance range on slightly stronger results from the core businesses. We delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, representing 18% year over year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32. I'll walk through the details of the results and guidance in a moment, but we're pleased to have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and, as a result, are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.23 to $1.27 range. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8% compared to 70.7% in Q2 of last year and includes a year over year negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 210 basis point increase over prior year and was at the high end of our guidance range due to favorable product mix in the quarter, particularly from the strength in [COMPANY] and men's health franchises. We continue to expect our full year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5%, which now assumes a negative [COMPANY] impact of 100 basis points for the year, a slight increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in April. Adjusted SGA expenses were $801 million or 35.5% of sales in Q2 2017, down 40 basis points year over year and at the midpoint of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We're delivering on our SGA improvement initiatives outlined in detail at our recent Investor Day, such as the optimization and expansion of our global shared services and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to target full year 2017 adjusted SGA in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which, at the midpoint, would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016. Adjusted research and development expenses were $239 million in the second quarter or 10.6% of sales, which is roughly flat year over year. We continue to expect full year adjusted [COMPANY] to be in a range of 10% to 11% and continue to target a rate of less than 10% by 2020, driven by geographic mix, greater efficiencies and leverage. Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q2, which is similar to the prior year, and we expect our royalty rate to remain approximately 1% of sales for 2017. As a result, Q2 2017 adjusted operating margin of 26% increased 260 basis points year over year and was at the midpoint of our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%. The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our [COMPANY] segment operating margin results. The [COMPANY] team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.9% for Q2 as the team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control and leverage the improved top line performance of the global business. As you would expect, in any given quarter, you may see some variation in adjusted segment operating margin, but we now expect the full year 2017 [COMPANY] adjusted operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%, which is an increase over our prior year expectations of 18% to 19%. The [COMPANY] and [COMPANY] segments also realized year over year improvements in adjusted operating margin of 40 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively, all while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches. Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q2 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q2 this year compared to 4% in Q2 last year. Adjusted other expense was $14 million in the second quarter and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments. We believe this is representative of a go forward run rate and annualizes to approximately $25 million per year. We still expect the full year below the line expense, which is comprised of interest expense, dilution from our venture investment portfolio and costs associated with our [COMPANY] hedging program, to be approximately $300 million in both 2017 and 2018. Of note, this excludes an impairment of certain of our investments of $53 million recorded in the quarter. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we've grown our portfolio of venture investments to over 30 companies. And as you'd expect, we may see impairments from time to time, but we continue to be very excited about the portfolio. Our tax rate for the second quarter was negative 16.3% on a reported basis and 13.9% on an adjusted basis, at the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. We continue to expect full year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13%. Finally, Q2 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 18% year over year growth or 24% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $298 million after tax, Q2 2017 [COMPANY] was $0.11. This is below our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.21, primarily due to litigation related charges of $205 million associated with our mesh litigation. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,779,000,000 as of June 30, 2017. During the quarter, as we continued working through settlement discussions and the related claims processing related to our mesh litigation, more of the potential settlement claims were verified than previously expected. As a reminder, to determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. We've entered into or are in the final stages of entering into master settlement agreements in principle with certain plaintiffs counsel to resolve an aggregate of approximately 38,000 of our approximately 48,000 known claims, which represents nearly 80% of those claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk in our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $409 million compared to $464 million in Q2 last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund the previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as the Symetis acquisition. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $195 million. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be $1,750,000,000, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements and the [COMPANY] stipulation of settled issues once finalized. Capital expenditures for the second quarter 2017 totaled $68 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million. We ended Q2 with 1,391,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,394,000,000 for Q3 and 1,393,000,000 for the full year 2017. Now I'll walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,890,000,000 to $8,990,000,000, which represents year over year growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis within a range of 6% to 8% growth. This guidance includes an approximate 120 basis point contribution from [COMPANY] and Symetis and represents 6% to 7% growth on a reported basis. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million for the full year 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth, and continue to assume the full year negative impact of [COMPANY] will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect [COMPANY] to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.74. Now turning to Q3 2017. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,180,000,000 to $2,210,000,000. This represents year over year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q3 revenue to be a $20 million headwind. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, representing 9% to 16% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.18 per share.

So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the [COMPANY].     Thanks, Dan. Tanya, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           QA_text_anonynm\n",
            "Sure, Phil. Thanks very much. I mean, you take a step back and let me just add a little context here. So I mean, we laid out our strategy in the second half last year and we're executing against that strategy. I'm really happy with the performance of the team and the reception (technical difficulty) with them over a protracted period of time. Our sales teams around the world are executing extremely well and they've been focused on building more direct strategic relationships at the C-level as well as investments in capacity, and those are really helping. So when you look specifically at the Workspace business, we did have a record number of $1 million-plus transactions. We had multiple 8-figure transactions. Good balance across the geos. Both the [COMPANY] area and North America were well into the double digits from a demand point of view on that side. I'd say that we had a quarter where you also saw perpetual license very strong as well. So while subscription was huge, and that drove a lot of the unbilled, I'll come back to it in a minute, we also had good perpetual license quarter. So the rising tide really lift the boat. Citrix Cloud is a big driver. All 10 of the largest deals there were all over $1 million each. The subscription mix within the Workspace crossed 50% for the first time, much higher if you include installed base trade-up as well. That's an early program, but one that's starting to get some good traction. And [COMPANY], which we haven't talked too much about, but just as a reminder, that's for our partners that are looking to build the infrastructure to deliver some sort of vertical services for their end customers. I mean, that business is still growing in the 30% to 40% range. So really across the board. Very happy with that.Yes, Phil. Good question. I mean, it's clear that we're, from a bookings stance -- standpoint, we're running well ahead of our original expectations. So on a trailing 12-month basis, where we're well over $1 billion of cash flow from ops, and that translates into the low-$7 free cash flow, a little bit behind that. So the way to think about cash flow, just as a reminder to everybody, that as we go through this transition, one of the things that we are doing is reducing the frequency of billing cycles. So we're putting more and more revenue on -- off the books, that was that big step-up in unbilled revenue that you saw. And so that really needs to be looked at in concert with actual reported cash flow. So please look at -- when you're trying to calculate bookings, look at the change in deferred, the change in unbilled and then recognized revenue. Those are really the 3 pieces to really triangulate what future cash flows are going to look like for us.Sure, Rob. It's both, of course. So you can look at it probably in 3 ways. One is when we talk about trade-up and transition, or [COMPANY], that we have referenced a couple of times. That is more of an installed base customer that we are migrating to Citrix Cloud. That is -- we kept that entirely out of the conversation so far, and I want to keep everything focused on net new. And so [COMPANY] is a motion that's now into the 8 figures, but it's still pretty early. We're going to focus more on that in the second half of the year. So net new is where the bulk of all the demand is coming from. That is, in some cases, because we're so broadly distributed. We're already touching almost all of the Global 5000, but these are net new opportunities within those accounts to a large degree. And then truly net new, companies that we have never done business with in any product in our history, we add several hundred per quarter.Rob, no aberration, I'd say. I mean, listen, we're super happy with the progress that we've made. I think this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've been able to raise our external expectations. I mean, we're taking full year guidance up by, I don't know, 100, 150 basis points from a growth rate point of view, and that's despite having a really large Q2, we're also raising expectations for Q3. So really positive, but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves as well. Seeing growth in product and subscription for this business at 20% is a growth rate we haven't seen in 8 years, so it's nice to see that happening. But I want to see a few more data points before we start talking about what the real trend of the rate is. So we're going to maintain a very positive and appropriate point of view going into Q3. Also, Q3 as you know, it's the summer quarter where customers are out for large parts of it, so it tended to be a little bit more back-end loaded. So once we get through Q3, we'll talk about where we think the new trend line is.Sure, Ted. I mean, the way to think about it is, when we talk about the integrated workspace, I mean, that's a combination of 3 big forces that we laid out in the middle of last year that are really shaping the way we're driving operations in the company. The first one is about unifying the portfolio. That's simply bringing point products and their development teams together so that we can create truly integrated solutions. That's one. Second piece was accelerating to the cloud so that we can build out a portfolio of cloud solutions to allow us to meet customers wherever they are in their journey. And frankly, I think most are going to be on a hybrid cloud model for some period of many years. And it's important for us to be able to help them bridge that, regardless of what they're trying to do in real time. And then third area is a little bit more about vision, and that's where the secure perimeter comes in, where we can talk about the evolution of networking services and how they are ultimately going to be impacted as more workloads move to the cloud, as compute moves out to the [COMPANY], it becomes a little more of a mesh of services over time. Now a lot of companies aren't deploying that way yet, but when they look at engaging with a partner like Citrix for a current project, being able to communicate the vision and where we're going to give them confidence that we're going to be there as their projects catch up to that, is really important. And it's one of the reasons why we've been focused so much on enabling our teams to sell at more strategic level, to be able to talk about the business from a top-down point of view and give this broader perspective of infrastructure versus point projects along the way. And I think that's one of the things that has really led to the uptick in large transactions. And again, like I said, it's very early coming out of [COMPANY], but the feedback that we've received from that on some of the newer initiatives that are, frankly, all hitting the market either in the last couple of weeks or in the next couple of weeks, great feedback. And we'll just work with customers to get those folks started in their infrastructure and see where we go from there.Drew, why don't you take that question?Yes. Sure. Great question, Ted. Yes. We're really pretty much through the -- just the [COMPANY] uplift. That really started over a year ago. And so most of that's rolling into revenue now. But in terms of the new business, the uplift that we're really seeing as we build deferred, as David pointed out -- or as we pointed out earlier, deferred and unbilled were up $170 million sequentially. And the bulk of that's really coming out of new business, primarily the subscription business. And again, 42% of the product bookings this quarter were subscription. So you could see the growth there. It's really driven off the new business on the subscription side.One interesting thing to add to that was that when we adopted 606 last quarter, we had to take a haircut of a better part of $100 million on deferred revenue as well. So some of that price uplift that we're able to achieve over the second half of last year, we had kind of get washed away from an accounting change. But that said, it's definitely one of the things that's helping drive the overall acceleration of revenue growth over the last 5 quarters.Yes, let me take the last part of that question first. I mean, the landscape continues to be very, very competitive, as you can imagine. So no change on that front. But you have to step back for a minute. It's the broader forces that we've talked about for a long time and were a key element of our overall [COMPANY] conference. I mean, the fact is people are concerned, [COMPANY]s, CEOs, about getting more productivity and engagement out of their workforce. And while this current era of computing, we call it the mobile cloud era, has created unprecedented flexibility from a compute standpoint and from a device standpoint. In most customers, their environment, all that does is add complexity. And so what they're doing is they're employing a number of little point product solutions to help address everything from app delivery to identity, to managing SaaS and connectivity. And that's excessive and it's complex. And so our approach has been to abstract away as much of that complexity as we can and provide this vision for a unified workspace and one that helps them cut cost, helps them simplify, but more importantly, kind of drives that enablement around productivity of the workforce; but do it in a secure manner, do it in a way that embraces the way that people are working today. So that's kind of the uber-backdrop and the message. And when it comes to individual customers, it depends on really what they're driving immediately from their own initiatives. I mean, the 2 that we referenced by name in the script, like -- Willis Towers Watson, everybody knows they're a leading advisory and brokerage firm with tens of thousands of employees. I mean, they're adopting a cloud-first approach. And so they're very much focused on Azure. And because of the partnership with [COMPANY], be able to help manage their entire workspace as a cloud-delivered service from Azure was really what -- the critical part of the conversation there. So that's one good example. Customers that also have large on-premise deployments, sometimes in very highly regulated industries or maybe outside the U.S., they're just going to continue to expand that, and that's what we saw at the same time. So just depends on where they are. I'd say longer term, most will migrate towards some form of hybrid cloud. That's certainly a core part of our strategy. But we want to make sure that we're not pushing customers to adopt faster than they're ready. And it's important for us to have this support for both architectures.I'll tell you my -- the high-level framework. This is an important way that we talk about it internally, that the Citrix Workspace app was designed as a general purpose solution. What I mean by that is it adds value to applications of all types: SaaS, mobile, virtualized, et cetera and as well as content and doing that in a way that doesn't rely on virtualization. And so that's an internal, important way for the people to think about it. It's not just a renaming or reimplementation of a virtualization solution, but it's truly general purpose infrastructure, and it allows you to address those use cases very individually and tailor those for every user inside of every enterprise. So when we think about it, that's strategically where we're going and why we announced some of these new capabilities like cloud app control service and others that are a critical part of that workspace vision. We're just bringing those to market now. There's obviously a long ways to go from an execution standpoint. But general purpose is clearly the way that we unlock a much broader opportunity than we might have been looking at in the past.I think the portfolio has gotten -- it's interesting, the portfolio has gotten a lot simpler over the last 2 or 3 years. I mean, that was a critical element. Is -- part of our strategy was about focusing on the things that are truly important to the customer and then stripping away everything else. And that's frankly, allowed us to go much faster from an execution point of view. When we think about the workspace and some of the new elements today, it's -- the core strategy, if you want to talk at a high level, it's a C-level conversation. It's an infrastructure conversation, it's not for the project buyer. That said, all of the advancements that we're making in the individual capabilities, be it in [COMPANY] or be it in file sync and share or virtualization, all of those are designed to enhance their category competitiveness as well as differentiation for those customers that are still looking at it purely from a project basis. But by the time we start talking about a large transaction, you're generally dealing with the [COMPANY], VP of IT, somebody at a very senior level that can help coordinate what might have historically been a point product buyer. And again, that's part of the enablement that we're working through right now. It's one of the things that when we bring customers into the briefing center, you'll see a mix nowadays of executive leadership, security, networking and others, just depends on where the customer is. And frankly, it depends a little bit on the customer's size.Well, I think as everyone knows, we had a pretty major strategy shift in that business over the course of the last year. The thing that we articulated was we were going to emphasize the integration with the holistic workspace and focus more on the enterprise than it had been as a cloud storage solution with a lot of [COMPANY]-type focus, and that's a core part of the strategy. And so, less of a standalone sale and more of a sale in the context of the workspace. I mean, that's the direction we're going, so I think the growth rate right now is just a reflection of that. I mean, we're not allocating dollars in between the bundles, so there's -- it's going to be consumed that way more and more over time. Probably 1 year to 2 years out, we'll be talking about the workspace as largely the one element of revenue, that's the one that matters most from a visibility standpoint. But today, it's still important to look at them individually.Yes, let me take the last question. I mean, unbilled -- I mean, as everybody has seen, unbilled had a really big spike in Q2. It had very, very strong bookings in the second quarter. We're not going to forecast that going out. It's one of those things that as we went through this transition, we committed to reporting to because we wanted to make sure that everybody has the elements necessary to truly measure the progress against our transformation, but we're just not going to forecast that at this point. Incredibly happy with the number in Q2 and we're certainly well above our internal expectations. As I mentioned before, the 2 largest geos both showed double-digit growth, which was great. We haven't disclosed it yet, on an [COMPANY] basis, we had similar growth rates to the [COMPANY]. And so, we're not changing duration at all, it's just a function of a really strong quarter. In terms of looking forward, I'll repeat what I said earlier that we're happy with where we are. We've been showing better and better progress every quarter. But I also want to just remain normally cautious like we always are in terms of forward outlook and let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's the summer quarter, so come back in Q3 and we'll talk about if we're on a different trajectory or not. And as of right now, we're executing against our 2022 plan that we laid out. We are ahead of the ramp rate clearly, but that's the backdrop that we're executing on right now.It's just [COMPANY] is the smallest of the 3 regions. It tends to be a little bit more volatile from a result standpoint. It's surprisingly consistent, having all 3 geos at that 7%, 8% at the same time. I wouldn't expect it to be that way from a underlying demand and bookings standpoint. As I said, the 2 strongest in Q2 were North America and Europe. Actually, the Americas and [COMPANY], let's put it that way, and [COMPANY] was trailing. That reverses itself probably in Q3 or [COMPANY]. But overall, we're just happy with the progress we're seeing across the globe, because our sales team are continuing to execute better and better all the time.Mark, I'm not sure I 100% understand your question. But I will say that over 50% of the [COMPANY] bookings for Workspace were subscription, leading to very little recognized. When we look at that growth in -- the growth in subscription from an unbilled standpoint, I mean, subscription's increased, what, a little over $70 million, Drew, sequentially? And the vast majority of that is just Workspace cloud -- Citrix Cloud, excuse me, for the Workspace. So that's really the driver. The underlying bookings, clearly were in the double-digit range.Well, sure.Well, I don't think it's important to break it out at this point. I'd rather not get into the habit of disclosing that because moving to subscription billing is the -- it is the strategy right now, and that's where we're going. And the fact that we can actually post accelerating growth while we're driving an even bigger percentage mix is pretty cool. We're very happy with that right now.Well, sure. I think that as we've been talking for the last year or so, I mean, we've been making a very direct effort to enhance our relationships at a strategic level with our customers. And we've been investing in everything from a number of global roles to do that, more quota sharing capacity. Mark Ferrer and team have been driving just a lot of operational changes across the board. That said, we still fulfill the vast, vast majority of our business through partners. The partner network is changing, as you would imagine. It's changing with the landscape of technology. So we have been recruiting new partners along the way, folks that are more comfortable with selling cloud and are participating with [COMPANY] network and areas like that. And we're continuing to work on enablement for our existing partners. We're -- I think we're still pretty early in the game from an enablement standpoint, that frankly, it's one of the reasons why the various channel check notes that I read pre-quarter, some were wildly positive and some were negative. And I think that's just a reflection of a channel in transition, and it's a matter of who you talk to. And so, we have several thousand partners that transact with us any given quarter. Some are moving much faster than others, and it's incumbent upon us to keep driving enablement, making sure we've got programs in place so that people can make a lot of money. And just from a program standpoint, we are trying to drive more aligned with the strategy and much less about trading up an installed base customer. And so, there's a strategy shift going on at the same time.Yes. Well, networking's -- no change in the competitive dynamics. I mean, it's always been a highly competitive market. And I think that if you look backwards, the business in [COMPANY], we've been taking share gradually for probably a decade now. And when we look at it, it's just kind of inching up. SSPs continue to be a little lumpy but they've -- I think we're doing a better job of broadening that base to help reduce some of the volatility there. But the bulk of the business is coming from the enterprise and I'd say that there's really 3 factors. One is that the customers that are focused on the workspace, we have built nice integrations across that. And so, you can do unique things with the combination of the solution that really differentiate and drive value, whether it's security, identity, performance, et cetera. In a typical competitive [COMPANY] account, we've got a really good hybrid cloud story. We've always been a software product that can be deployed across hardware appliances, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And that's just given us a lot of flexibility to [address a swing] at whatever project that a customer has. And I would say the one area that's popped out as a differentiator over the last couple -- last year, 1.5 years has been around analytics. And so our analytics approach just provides a lot more visibility into the network or the workspace or the user, if you're one of those customers, and that's been a nice differentiator. So we've got a good solution there, and I think we probably continue to take share, it's on a gradual basis.Yes. The partnership's great. I mean, it's been strong now for 2 decades. It's a really important part of what we do because [COMPANY] is so synonymous with applications and a critical part of our customer environments. We continue to work very closely on a lot of different initiatives, whether it's integration, extension on the mobile side. They're an important part of what we're doing to integrate with [COMPANY], in [COMPANY]. The cloud side is obviously super important as we have leveraged Azure in not only as the foundation for our cloud, but when we go in and drive joint solutions with customers, Azure is certainly getting a lot of traction when it comes to enterprise workloads, so a lot of mind share on that side. When we can talk about bringing things together relatively seamlessly, that's a nice value-add. And then just as we've leveraged the platform for resource zones, like we made an announcement at [COMPANY] that we're going to be working with Azure Gov for those types of customers that want Citrix Cloud in a highly regulated environment. So it's pretty multifaceted and just a great partnership for a long time now.Yes. I'd say that in terms of raising the 2020 and 2022, I mean, we're 3 quarters in as -- when we laid them out the first time, and it's great to be well ahead. And yes, we'll come back and revisit it from time to time. I mean, when we were in May, which was just couple of months ago, we added another couple of years to that, which shows the further inflection and the power of the model transition. So I mean, we'll see. I don't think we're in any rush to update the longer-term targets, but we certainly will when it becomes obvious that we're just running well ahead of plan, no timeline at this point.When I talk about that, as you look at some of the adjacencies around the newer initiatives, newer meaning the analytics side of the house, the Secure Digital Perimeter, it opens up some opportunities for us. But in terms of [COMPANY] expectations, like everybody, we are constantly looking at opportunities but we have a good discipline. We have a good discipline for answering the question of what exactly do we get synergies from, whether it's a buyer, a route to market, a technology platform, and we just don't have a -- we don't have a desire to acquire for the sake of acquiring. And so, we will be -- we'll continue to be active looking and then it's just got to be the right fit for us actually to move forward.Yes, yes. Actually, we don't talk too much about standalone mobile that much anymore. We talk about it in the context of the workspace. And people -- talk back a couple of quarters, I mean, a large part of our strategy on mobile was to get out of the commodity side of mobility and [COMPANY], [COMPANY]M is kind of a commodity-type service and look at it in the context of the workspace. So what we've done is drive integrations across the workspace and really expanded that from a universal endpoint management standpoint. So if you look at some of the new announcements around [COMPANY], we really have probably the broadest approach to universal endpoint management now, including certain [COMPANY] devices and other things. So our approach is going to be less standalone and more integrated. That's a common theme across our portfolio right now because like I said earlier, the challenge that all of our customers are having of managing all of these discrete point products is complex and it's hard. And the more that we can simplify, I think the more interesting that it's going to be. The only other thing that I mentioned just a minute ago on an earlier question is the work that we'll continue to do with [COMPANY] to embrace and extend [COMPANY] in the ways that really help those customers have what is a great solution, but there's just more we can do on that to partner.Sure, Rob. Again, just looking forward, we -- we're riding -- we do feel like we got a bit of a tailwind off of [COMPANY], and we wanted to make sure we're building out for the rest of the year and next year. And we've obviously been very disciplined on spending. What we wanted to do was just get really focused, laser-focused on where we saw opportunities for return. And so we've been investing really in 2 things, I think, demand generation, lead generation and then turning that back into the sales force and building capacity in quota-carrying reps and [COMPANY]. And that's been the focus of it and obviously, we saw a strong close to the quarter, as you could see in the numbers. And really, just focusing on delivering the messages from [COMPANY] about cloud. And so far, everything we've seen has paid off and we're going to continue to do that into the future. But you could see, we've obviously, during the year, taken up the op margin guidance and overperformed this quarter as well. So it's looking very good.Let me just add on top of that. There's 2 other areas that are important. One is just the overall awareness and branding. I mean, we were -- we need to be a little bit more visible. Part of this transition and transformation is helping reshape Citrix in terms of more general-purpose versus being focused historically on virtualization, so that's one. On a related note is also around enablement, which I've mentioned a couple of times. And we've got a lot of work to do, as you would imagine, in terms of just continuing to drive enablement forward across both our internal teams and our partners around the world.Yes, John. As you know, the -- I guess, it's probably over a year ago now when we laid out a new way we wanted to report revenue, maybe 6 quarters ago in anticipation of lining the strategy up so it'd be easier to really get a view of where we're going. That's why we broke out subscription as the primary focus. When I look at the business, I tend to look at the combination of product plus subscription together as a way to measure the success of the (inaudible). And so if I look at networking for example, the product plus subscription, networking was about 7% growth, and the product plus subscription and workspace was about 20% growth. And so, that's how we look at it internally. There was no weird anomalies in terms of SSPs on the network side. Networking growth was 5% and within that, the slowest element was around maintenance, maintenance grew like 3%. And then the rest of it was the settlement I mentioned. Does that help?Yes. I mean, look, what's really happening is we're building the new business, it's the cloud and subscriptions. And you could see it in the combination of the deferred revenue -- the deferred and unbilled growth, so $170 million quarter-on-quarter. And that's where you're really seeing the new business build. The great thing is there obviously you get predictability of revenue. You create better economics because it's a recurring revenue stream, I think which we all like. And then from the [COMPANY] perspective, yes, there's a little bit left, but I think we're really through anything material there. And there's always a little bit of a tail there, but it's very small at this point. We lapped that during the quarter -- earlier in the year.Well, let me clarify one thing. I mean, there's no way to avoid necessarily. I mean, because when we look at the upgrade paths, if you're an existing customer, there's one path that moves from a support offering, and then there's another path that moves from [COMPANY]. And the only difference is really, price. You're kind of working backwards from what the cloud price is. And it's not a price increase, I also want to be pretty careful when we talk about that because this is really about just demonstrating incremental value when we talk about cloud. And this was back to the enablement point that I mentioned before. And so the cloud, when we deliver cloud, it's not just -- like I said, it's not just about our infrastructure, but all of the new innovations that are only available as a cloud service. Like for example, unified experience, the analytics platform, the cloud app control service that I mentioned before, federated identity, integrated content. All of these things are really the value-add that a customer gets when they consume Citrix Cloud, granted that they'll all be consuming that at a different pace. But that's really been the main driver. When we talk about installed base, there's a program called trade-up and transition or [COMPANY]. That's what we've referenced for a few quarters now, and that was -- that business is starting to ramp. It's now into the 8 figures from a [COMPANY] point of view, but it's really a second half focus item more than anything else. So as we laid out at Analyst Day, the first part of this year is about just driving net new demand, net new customers and really getting that engine going and trying to incent both our field teams and our go-to-market on those items. And so that's where the very big bulk of compensation comes from. And then the [COMPANY] piece is a little bit downstream. So again, critical part of our subscription transition, but one that we wanted to sequence behind the net new.Yes, a few things. I mean, one is when we look at the [COMPANY], I know there's a lot of acronyms, but the cloud service provider part, that business is largely -- well, it's all partner driven and it's largely focused on that [COMPANY] segment. That is well into the plus 100 million run rate at this point in time. And it's growing somewhere north of 30%. And so that's probably the most direct way that we look at that. I mean, as we go forward, some of the other initiatives that we are thinking about is continuing to simplify the approach to the cloud, make the products more applicable to a smaller, simpler use case. But just really where the infrastructure gives the most value is when you typically have a larger, more complex environment, some concern around security and governance compliance. I mean, those are the types of attributes that are driving such success in markets or verticals like financial services and government and health care and others. So not -- I wouldn't say we're more focused on the enterprise today. It's just that the enterprise is a strong market.Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Obviously, we're working really hard on continuing to execute against our strategy. We're very happy with the results in Q2 and the ability to continue to increase our outlook as we go forward. Thank you very much, everyone, for your support, and thank you for joining us today. Look forward to talking to everybody again in about 3 months. Thank you.\n"
